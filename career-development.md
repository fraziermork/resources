many people get their first position through networking, 
but it's important to do all the actual high-volume job searching for practice, jsut in case etc. 
  there's a huge funnel down from applications sent down to actual interviews received, so need to do a huge amount of initial applications
  keep track of the applications that you sent out
  recommendation for number is minimum of 15 applications a week, but really this is way too low, probably more like 30 is better 
  many boards, linkedin, etc. have built-in applications/easy-apply, no reason not to use this
  

even when you don't have a lot of time, a good way to stay up-to-date is by doing some market research 
Lot's of companies are opening offices in Seattle to tap into the coders here - you can find out about stuff like that by reading on these places
also helps keep track of which things are the new, trendy things


linkedin:
  biggest one, even in Tech
  also have lots of groups that you can join--recommended to join groups related to interests and companies you are interested in working for 
  in summary
    have profile, then also list skills
    skill endorsements at the bottom are ok, but not as important as what you list explicitly 
    make sure industry listed as some sort of tech thing     
  can also get introductions to people via linkedin, if one of your contacts has a contact you want to get in touch with
  recommendations are also a big deal--if you build something for someone, have them give you a recommendation on linkedin 
  when you do searches, look at the variety of titles of people at companies in the general roles you're looking for
    that way you can see what their job titles are and refine your search terms 
  save your searches
  
  
Search guides:
  on a weekend, on linkedin, appply to all relelvant jobs posted in the posted 2-7 days ago category, same for 8-15
  
cover letter:
  your pitch, extended
  also talk about technologies you've used
  half page max 
  if customized, talk about company in particular--many large companies won't care, but smaller ones very well may 
  
glassdoor: 
  glassdoor is a critical tool to use

startups post jobs in a different way from most larger companies:
  angellist is a big one
  many of these will offer equity more than competitive salaries though

agency recruiters:
  can put in an hour of work here and potentially see results
  many companies outsource recruitment to these large recruiting agencies
  cybercoders is a good one that hires a lot of entry level cybercoders
  most of them also have their own job boards
  can go on linkedin, find recruiters at each of these places, and email resume to each of them
  they have a rep for ghosting on people, they're unlikely to be super engaged in you in particular
  

Approach to job search:
  be very targeted with your applications if you are approaching something in particular that you are interested in
  you should also apply in high volume, not enough time to change cover letter for everything, just use shotgun therapy and see what sticks
  
  if you don't make it into a job because dont meet tech requirements, keep in touch with some of the people that you like and reach back out to them once you have more exp, be building network for long term as well as short term
  use existing connections to get feedback about what's impressive, what isn't, use that to refine what you've got
  
  add recruiters on linkedin if you can, if it isn't weird, because they'll have a lot of stuff listed, liked, etc. related to job search
  
Informational meetings:
  these are a good way to get your foot in the door
  also a good way to assess someone as a potential mentor
  have as many mentors as possible, in a broad range of categories, and both for short term progress and long-term goals
  you can find people to do informational meetings with by utilizing your existing network
  if you go to an interview and aren't up to the tech requirements, but you like the person/are interested, ask for contact info for long term, see if you can ask them questions about how to move forward
  
Meetups/hackathons/conferences:
  go to these, even if prize is minor, people still liked your work,
  how to tell which hackathons are worth going to--on meetup you can see how many people are members, how many people go, use that to filter
  can tell which hackathons are legit based on company sponsors (if you've heard of them, etc.), # of attendees if listed, 

  
Difference between full-time, contract, and freelance:
  contract stuff has a stigma, but increasingly common
    short term or short-term to hire
    hourly paid
    tend to be paid more but w/ fewer benefits
  contract to hire is sort of like having a short internship to see whether they want to hire you or not
  
  freelance work can be a good short-term thing while on the job search
    can definitely include this in your list of experience on your resume
    upwork is growing in popularity, craigslist too
    there are lots of places to find people/nonprofits to volunteer for and code, can get experience to show, idealist is good for this
    

searching for job listings:
  boolean string searches work well
    dice, indeed, and linkedin 
  save your searches for later
  play around with the wording to find more job listings with slightly different job titles


informational recruiter call
  many of these will be with recruiters who aren't necessarily tech savvy
  don't underrate yourself, especially given that there will be a ramp-up period
  they'll prob want to know what CF is, what curriculum is like, etc. 
    10 week certification
    bootcamp
    took 201, 301 beforehand
  talk about projects that you've been working on
    intention
    which tools you used
    why you chose to use tools you used, decision making, justification
    requirements
    explain thought process through the whole thing
    probably will ask about other aspects, like leadership, etc. 
  may ask you multiple choice questions 
  want to know what you were up to before that
  nontechnical people may also verify your ability by asking you to explain some stuff--knowledge needed to simplify stuff
  if you are actively interviewing, tell your recruiter because
    you are getting interviews
    you look competitive
    shows you are being valued by many groups/social proof
    
code challenge:
  typically 60-90 min to take an online test
  usually finish w/ in a week of reeiving the links
  tracks live coding, work live into the coding challenge, but paste into a local file to save stuff in case internet screws up
  some sites like hackerrank, have scoring rubrics posted 
  sooner you do it, the sooner it'll be evaluated

technical phone interview:
  usually about 60 min 
  when answer your phone, say 'hello, this is frazier', not 'hello'
  you share your screen with them as you code
  you have to talk out loud as you think through a problem 
  can get partial credit for 'showing your work' by talking your way through
  
Questions you can ask them:
  how often are their sprints
  what technologies are they using, how often to they change them up, do dif teams use dif ones, etc. 

  
  
  
on-site tech interviews:
  typically 4-6 hours
  usually several short 1-1 sessions--ask who they are, what their role is, how I would be interacting with them if I got the job
  may not always be interviewed by the manager whose team you will be on, esp. at large companies
    if that's the case, you should definitely ask to meet or talk via phone with the person who would be your actual manager
  dressing for interviews:
    may be diff between a tech company vs. a non-tech co looking to hire a dev
    totally reasonable to ask what to wear to an interview
  many of these sessions will be technical question sessions, but many will be behavioral interviewing sessions
  bring own dry erase markers
  offer to write tests 
  talk about levels of implementations, mvp vs. more in depth, simple methods vs. more efficient methods, brute force v. elegant etc. 
  think carefully about the questions you want to ask them:
    what is ramp up time like?
    mentorship approach / onboarding? 
    work life balance
    approach to continuing education, investing in their employees
    what is success like in this role
    growth prospects internally for devs
    whats the problem solving method for projects that need help, are delayed, etc. 
    what challenges would I face? 
    what homework could I do ahead of time to prepare myself?
    where would I be sitting, how big would my team be, who would I be seeing everyday? 
    what is work culture like?
  glassdoor and indeed let you leave comments, indeed actually requires verification that you work there though  

technical side of interviewing:
  problem solving
    ask for clarification, engage them, talk to them, 
    think out loud, justify choices
  data structures
    common uses
    tradeoffs
    implementation details
  coding/whiteboarding solutions
    syntax correct, working
    language: mem management, common libraries, etc. 
  oop
  things I could do to distinguish myself:
    offer to solve the problem a different way just for fun
    offer to write tests
    talk about brute force v elegant solution
    talk about ways to go further with the problem, if possible, to make it more interesting/better

behavioral side:
  they are trying to figure out how fast you learn, whether you pick things up from other people, whether you take guidance
  they're interested in seeing if you're competent, their hints and guidance are valuable, ask for it if you can
  engage them as a person, be genuine, 
  they often want to see:
    ownership in projects
    how you work on a team
    what things you actually worked on in the team
    followthrough 
    considerations that went into the design
    results, successes, learning from mistakes, etc. 
    what you learned from it, what you'd do differently
  STAR is most common 
    situation
    task
    action 
    result
  talking about how you would do better is good--vocally self critical  
  you want to exude qualities like
    biased towards action and getting things done
    capable
    able to learn new stuff 

interview best practices:
  practice coding by hand
  use online coding sites to get used to doing little problems
  explain your thought process out loud
  start thinking through prev. exp. and framing them in STAR
  create list of good questions to ask interviewers
  

interview homeworks:
  ask for feedback
  add readme, comment your code 
  write tests 
  write extras if you can--go the extra mile
