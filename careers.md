interviewing:

emily speaking:
  stay in touch with CF network 
  mention quick learner, fast on-boarder
  ask the why they chose to bring you in to interview
  ask what their typical day looks like
  ask for feedback on your code challenge
  figure out salary negotiation
    short story: always ask for more
    if they are making money, ask high
  
Summary from talking with charlie:
  if going to get a masters, get it in machine learning or something, not in just CS, but worthwhile
  potential career path to get a job somewhere doing stuff then maneuver your way into doing more data-y stuff
  path is definitely possible, particularly because no one majors in 'data science'
  python makes most sense to learn on the side in the short term
  react by far best other framework to learn atm, doesn't know anything about meteor, hold off on learning angular 2 until there are jobs with it
  front end easier to get work in, back end tends to pay better, although that may be changing
  pick silly projects based on tangential interests as excuses to learn something, like his socket app
  no real answer on how to distinguish self, just do stuff you like 
  meetups worthwhile if outgoing, less so if not able to talk to strangers, hackathons too, shotgun therapy is best
  while applying for jobs, send out a bunch at a time
  try to schedule interviews in order of increasing interest
  docker very backend, not worth learning until details of deployment become important
  bootstrap worth knowing, but documentation may be weak
  sugar, immutablejs, ramdi or something are interesting libraries to know to varying extents
  interviewbit is a good place to learn theoretical coding, along with cracking the coding interview
  portfolio was not how he got his jobs--he got them through networking primarily
  said internships make sense iff at a big company, i.e. amazon, facebook, google, etc., unlikely to be worth it at smaller place unless guaranteed to be good, mentioned whitepages too
  freelancing can be fun, don't expect to make any money until have had several big clients
  if TAing, try to TA for higher level classes as opposed to lower level classes
  
  
  
  
Summary from talking with Brian:
  First clients will have to be cheap, then can work your way up
  avoid freelance boards, everyone there will undercut you, not offering anything different from people there
  if can get initial clients, can work your way up
  initial clients can be used to fund development of modules you'll use for later clients, like ecommerce stuff, etc. 
  past the first couple clients, should be aiming for stuff in the 5kish range
  don't be language specific, offer to fix anything, project gives you paid chance to learn something new
  all projects should be slightly more difficult than what you are comfortable with
  xcode has a good ios simulator for proofing, the only one that is totally accurate for ios devices
  shopify is excellent to learn, would be really strong endorsement/skill, shopify tracks endorsements, 
    once you get 5 positive reviews you get labelled a shopify expert, looks better
  probably will have to use stripe for some payment stuff
  use a cms, almost certainly going to need to, use one that someone else has built
  build a template that you can show to prospective clients that you can use to market with
  build a strong brand immediately to market yourself with so that professional/brand presence looks clear, slick, etc. 
  don't send emails as word docs, send as pdfs that are branded, 
  build out a nice company homepage that you can use to build out prof presence
  in long term, can shift from building services to building apps, like stripe or whatever, that people can buy and use, or like wordpress plugins that people pay for
  features that you can claim to offer 
    better website
    mobile friendly website
    ecommerce 
    optimization-ab testing, etc.
