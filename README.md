# resources
This is a collection of links, resources, etc. that I have compiled while learning to code. If I run across a resource that's helpful or a topic that I don't understand yet, I put a link here so I have a record of what I've learned and what I still need to learn. 

As I move forward in my job hunt, I've decided to put this up so that there is a record of my thought process and learning experience. This isn't intended to be a public resource--it's just a window into my frenzied attempts to teach myself to code.
