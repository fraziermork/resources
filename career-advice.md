whiteboarding advice:
  be comfortable
  as with all things, start with problem domain, figuring out what you need, before writing any code
  think out loud and on whiteboard instead of on writing down things you're sure are correct--they want to know how you think
  write clearly, take time to name variables sensibly
  write big
  if don't know something, explain how you would find out

advice from socrata talk:
  come to their meetups 
  do projects in several languages to demonstrate ability to do more than one thing
  demonstrate an interest in the company coming to interview
  knowledge of the specific language that you'll be using is less important than a demonstrated ability to solve problems
  typical job interview is 30min phone/coffee convo for fit/background, then if pass homework prob, then day of in-person technical interview

advice from codefellows panel:
  post as much code as possible to github, regardless of whether it is finished
  be honest that you are a junior developer, don't interview for jobs for senior devs
  it's ok to apply for jobs that say they require a couple years or whatever--that's their ideal, not what they expect
  demonstrated writing ability is also important
  customize your applications, cover letters, resume for positions, companies
  read job applications carefully
  have questions for interviewer as well
    if I got the job, what is something I could do to prepare ahead of time?
    what is company culture like
    what opportunities do they have for advancement
    what sort of mentorship/onboarding do they have, make sure they're going to set you up well, don't want a repeat experience
    have suggestions for company if possible--shows you're engaged, have thought about things
    if possible, see whether it would be possible to do cs masters at UW at night or something
  try to do something to get noticed to stand out from other applicants
  network as much as possible:
    go to meetups, hackathons, etc. 
    go to job fairs, learn social etiquette for these events
    get linkedin professional looking asap so that recruiters can contact me instead
    contribute to large projects on github, even if not making technical contributions, can contribute by improving docs, etc. 
    bring resumes that you can hand out where appropriate, or at least have clean linkedin and portfolio to show
    
Advice from Uncle Ron:
  lots of free or cheap lectures online
  modern jobs may require you to jump between jobs in order to advance, earn more, etc. but should stay at least 2 yrs 
  for JS, learn
    BackboneJS -- good starting point for frameworks
    AngularJS -- this is the main one
    jquery -- everyone needs to know this
    could learn React + flux too -- done by facebook
  also learn:
    golang -- google server side stuff 
    python -- look into checkio, a learning game
    noSQL stuff
      MongoDB
      OR spark https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SPARK_(programming_language)
  subscribe to newsletters
    oreilly
    techcrunch
    language specific as appropriate
    
Advice from dad:
  learn JS first, become a generalist for first job, specialize later
  they'll hire people they like and figure out where to put the later, do cool stuff so they'll want to hire you
  writing the most efficient code possible in unnecessary--focus on writing clear, usable code that anyone can pick up and use
  appearance is huge--no one will bother to look at the guts of a project that doesn't look cool--have to hook them immediately 
  in long term, look into becoming specialist in fields of AI or big data (probably going to get closer to eachother)
  
previous job advice from science:
  come to interviews with suggestions, ideas for the company  -- guy at CNF said had no problems getting into correct lab 
  do your homework ahead of time -- know exactly what you're walking into
